# Simple Todo list's server based on JSON Server


## Instructions

Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start Server

```bash
$ npm start --watch db.json
```

Now if you go to [http://localhost:3000/lists/1](), you'll get

```json
{ id: 1, name: "test list" }
```

Also when doing requests, its good to know that
- If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically and safely saved to `db.json` using [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).
- Your request body JSON should be object enclosed, just like the GET output. (for example `{"name": "Foobar"}`)
- Id values are not mutable. Any `id` value in the body of your PUT or PATCH request wil be ignored. Only a value set in a POST request wil be respected, but only if not already taken.
- A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a `Content-Type: application/json` header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will result in a 200 OK but without changes being made to the data.


## Routes

Based on the previous `db.json` file, here are all the default routes. 


```
